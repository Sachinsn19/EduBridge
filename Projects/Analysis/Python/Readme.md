# House Price prediction(Linear Regression)
This is my machine learning project on USA house price dataset. The project was done on Jupyter Notebook using Python programming language and Linear Regression algorithm. The libraries used were numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn. The aim of the project was  to predict price of USA houses. The dataset contains columns such as Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms, Area Population, Price, Address.  The project was concluded with the  predicted values of house price with highly correlated features  such as Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Area using Linear regression.
